            <p>
                People are often lacking motivation to complete what they are assigned to do. It can be anything from small
                household task to serious work-related assignments. This kind of the task does not matter as in the end,
                people just cannot get themselves to finish them. This can later trigger other problems as a result of
                not accomplishing the primary ones.
            </p>

        <div class="content-main-section">
            <h2>What research were done? </h2>

            <p>
                To identify a problem, a survey was implemented. In order to create a good solution, a problem must be
                defined first. In this case, an examination was used to accomplish this objective. The question asked
                was open and straight to the point: "Do you have any problem?". The survey was published in groups on
                social media. It targeted primally students and other not closer defined people. The survey resulted in
                answers that varied from serious to irrelevant. The problem dominating was lack of motivation to
                complete task which concludes this survey.

            <h2>Why is this a problem? </h2>

            <p>
                Not being motivated can cause a lot of different consequences for people. The consequences can range
                from getting a mark, coming late, to missing a due date to a project. This can cause added stress to
                people, which would not help the case of being unmotivated. Therefore, loss of motivation can be
                categorised as a problem.
