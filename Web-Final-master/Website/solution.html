            <h2>What is the solution? </h2>

            <p>
                The solution is a social platform that connects working people together. One way to get motivated is to
                work together. The solution implements a place where people with similar interests and hobbies can meet
                and collaborate easily. Working together gives a lot of perks such as getting help, support and making
                friends. The platform allows for public, group and private collaboration. It would also be a place to
                list and join “meet requests”, making it easy for people to find "buddies". Creating space to cooperate
                could solve the problem.

            <h2>How does the solution work? </h2>

            <p>
                The solution will be brought into practice by developing an app that helps people interact with each
                other. This will lead to people gaining motivation to fulfill tasks such as studying, going to the gym,
                cleaning at home etc. The idea of having a partner will help people keep track of deadlines, help
                proofreading assignments before turning them in and in overall diminish procrastination. A reward system
                can also be implemented which will activate the inner competitive spirit. The app could also have
                streaks that would make the user consistent and efficient.
